# Turtle_racing_game

This program utilizes the python library Turtle, in order to draw turtles on the display.
At the beginning, the user is supposed to place a bet, which turtle is going to win. 
Next the race starts and the turtles race each other, with random speeds. The turtle that reaches first the edge of the right screen is the winner, and determines whether the bet was lost or won.  

To run the program, execute main.py.
