# Coffee_machine_simulation

It's a simple digital version of a coffee machine, simulating the option of buying one of three available coffees: espresso, latte, or cappuccino. It keeps track of the coffee machine's resources and gives a prompt accordingly if it is lacking any of them. The user can check the remaining resources with the command 'report' and shuts the machine down for maintenance with the command 'off'. The machine also keeps track of the money made from the coffee (accepted coins: penny (1 cent), nickel (5 cents), dime (10 cents), quarter (25 cents)). It calculates the inserted coins and gives back change if there is any.

In order to run the program simply execute main_coffee_machine.py
