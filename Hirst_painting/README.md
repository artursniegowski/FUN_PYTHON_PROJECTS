# Hirst_painting

It is a project where we try to recrate some art of the famouns Damien Hirst random spot paintings using python libraries: cologram for defining color palette from a painintg (color_palette.jpg). 
Next we use the library Turtel and the extracted colors to draw a random spot painting.  

Drawing constrains:
10 by 10 dots, which each size 20 and spacing 50 (Turtle sizing)
