# Higher_Lower_game

The program compares one search term against another search term. 
It retrieves data from a JSON file with usernames from Instagram and its followers. 
The user is given a choice between two randomly selected Instagram names, to decide who has more followers.
For a correct guess the score will be adjusted by 1, otherwise the user will lose 
and will be prompted the amount of points collected so far. Each decision is worth 1 point.

You can run this program by executing main_higher_lower.py
