# Blackjack
Blackjack is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. 
It uses decks of 52 cards. It's also known as Twenty-One. In the game, 
the players compete only against the dealer. The aim is to get a sum of all cards 
totaling as close as possible to 21 (including). With the combination of an ace and 
another 10 value card called "blackjack".
This is a simplified version of the popular game Blackjack, written in Python. 
The game keeps track of the probability of cards based on the decks played 
and cards removed from them. The base scenario is with 8 decks of cards and 
after playing 2 decks of cards, all decks will get reshuffled, in order to 
reset the probabilities.  

# Caesar Cipher
A Caesar cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, E would become H, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. The program encrypts and decrypts the given text according to the Caesar Cipher. 

# Guess_The_Number
Guess the secret number in the range 1-100 (including endpoints).
If your guess is too high or too low, you'll get a hint.
The user has a limited amount of attempts to guess the right number,
based on the level they choose to play.

# Hangman
Hangman is a guessing game where the player has to guess the whole word,
letter by letter. Every time the guess is wrong, Â the player loses a life and 
a "Hangman" ASCI art will be progressive, drawn out. In order to win, the player 
has to guess all the letters before the hangman is drawn. 

# Higher_Lower_game

The program compares one search term against another search term. 
It retrieves data from a JSON file with usernames from Instagram and its followers. 
The user is given a choice between two randomly selected Instagram names, to decide who has more followers.
For a correct guess the score will be adjusted by 1, otherwise the user will lose 
and will be prompted the amount of points collected so far. Each decision is worth 1 point.
  
# Pokemon_Search_API
It is a program which uses the API https://pokeapi.co/ to look through the database of the pokemons. 
The user is asked about the name of the pokemon and after entering it the program will show some detailed information about his choice.
