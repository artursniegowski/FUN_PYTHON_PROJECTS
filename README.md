# Automating_job_applications_on_linkedin
This is an automated job application bot. The program will use selenium WebDriver 
to automate applying for jobs on LinkedIn with the "Easy Apply" function to send applications to all the jobs that meet your criteria (instead of just a single listing).
In the first step, it will log in to your LinkedIn account, and then go to the specific search job URL defined in the program by the user. 
After accessing this URL, the bot will go through each of the application and asses if there is a function of Easy Apply.
If it doesn't exist, the job application will be skipped, and the bot will move to the next job application.
After finding the Easy Apply button, the bot will submit the first step of application by pressing it.
In the next step, the bot will validate how the application form looks. 
If the application form will have the button next which indicates a multistep application, the bot will terminate the application,
only application with "submit application" will be accepted. 
The bot will submit the application, and fill in the given phone number and send out the application.
After that, the bot will move to the next job application.

# Blackjack
Blackjack is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. 
It uses decks of 52 cards. It's also known as Twenty-One. In the game, 
the players compete only against the dealer. The aim is to get a sum of all cards 
totaling as close as possible to 21 (including). With the combination of an ace and 
another 10 value card called "blackjack".
This is a simplified version of the popular game Blackjack, written in Python. 
The game keeps track of the probability of cards based on the decks played 
and cards removed from them. The base scenario is with 8 decks of cards and 
after playing 2 decks of cards, all decks will get reshuffled, in order to 
reset the probabilities.  

# Caesar Cipher
A Caesar cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, E would become H, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. The program encrypts and decrypts the given text according to the Caesar Cipher. 

# Cheap_flight_finder
This program will find cheap flight deals and notify the user via email about the best prices. The user has to define a Google spreadsheet, which the program will use to keep track of the locations that we want to monitor and a price cutoff (a historical low price) which will be used as a threshold for defining a deal. As well as spreadsheet with all the users that will be notified if there is a low deal hit.  
The data from the spreadsheets will be accessed via an API - Google Sheet Data Management - https://sheety.co/ .
Next, the retrieve data will be feed into a flight search API - https://partners.kiwi.com/ , 
and in the first step, the IATA codes will be autocompleted. After all fields are filled in our spreadsheet, the program will feed this data into a flight search API that will run every day, searching through all the locations. Looking for the cheapest flight. When it comes up with a hit, and it finds a flight that's actually cheaper than our predefined price, then it's going to send that data and price via an email to all the users defined in our spreadsheet.

# Coffee_machine_simulation

This is a famous technique that helps people time-manage and to get more stuff done.
If you're figuring out a time-consuming task, then you can set your timer to 25 minutes and then work on the task for 25 mins and after that you take a short five-minute break. After doing four of these sequence repetitions called pomodoros, you take a longer break between 15-30 mins. This way you can break your work into intervals, which arguably helps with information retention and to stay motivated. This program will help you keep track of time according to the famous pomodoro technique. It is a timer with a tomato on it, and when you click start, it is going to tell you to work for 25 minutes. Then that window can go into background and while you are working on your task, when the timer's up it will pop to the very front of the screen above all the other windows and tell you to take a break. So the first break is for 5 mins, and you will notice the program will mark which pomodoro cycle was completed. Once you're done with the break, it's going to go back to work, and it's going to continue until you reach the longer break or until you click to stop or reset the timer. This program will help you to do these Pomodoro where you have 25 minute work, 5 mins break. You do four of these 25 mins sessions, and you get a 20-minute break.
