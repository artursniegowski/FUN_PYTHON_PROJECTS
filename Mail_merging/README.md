The program takes a template.txt, which contains a default message and names.json file, with a list of names, we want to send the template message to. The program will loop through each of the names from the input folder names.json file and will replace the [name] in the template message with the names in the json file and save for each name a separate file customized to the name in the output folder. It is an example where we can use python for writing multiple messages to different people, and let the Â program do the repetitive task of adjusts the names for us.

The program was developed using python 3.10.05. According to the OOP methodology. 

In order to run the program, you have to execute the main.py.
