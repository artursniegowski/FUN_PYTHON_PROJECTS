# Banking_app

The Banking app was created with OOP methodology and demonstrating the use of decorators and 
generators with a class. It is a program that tracks the transactions. The user is first 
prompted with a message to put his credentials (first and last name), 
and later there are three options to choose from.       
'deposit' - for depositing the money       
'withdraw' - for withdrawing the money    
'quit' - for exiting the system             
The program will track the balance of the given account based on the user choices,
and all the transactions will be logged into a txt file.

In order to run the program, you have to execute banking_system.py.
